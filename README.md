# Linux_Programing

All the sources is written on UNIX system so if you want to run these files you should use UNIX OS instead for the least inconvenient because we can't run Unix executable file on Window system. They use different formats. Unix use the ELF format almost on most architectures, while Windows uses the PE format.

By the way, you could use Vscode, Eclipse,... to compile sources code there then run file exe on Windows. But i'm not encouraging this option.
